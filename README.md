# Multivariate Normality Analysis

## ðŸ“„ Project Description

This repository contains the code and analysis for a project focused on **exploring multivariate normality** within a dataset. The report's objective is to conduct a **detailed analysis** to determine whether the data meets the assumptions of multivariate normality. The analysis includes:

- **Descriptive Statistics**: Calculation of descriptive measures for the involved variables.
- **Correlation Visualization**: Creation of scatter plots and correlation matrices.
- **Informal Multivariate Normality Tests**: Visual assessment of multivariate normality.
- **Formal Multivariate Normality Tests**: Application of statistical tests such as Shapiro-Wilk, Mardia, and others.

This analysis is crucial for determining whether the data can be appropriately used in statistical methods that assume multivariate normality.

## ðŸ“Š Project Contents

1. **R Code**: Scripts and functions for conducting the analysis.
2. **Descriptive Statistics**: Calculation and analysis of descriptive measures.
3. **Correlation Visualization**: Scatter plots and correlations among variables.
4. **Multivariate Normality Tests**:
    - Informal tests: Confidence ellipses, Q-Q plots.
    - Formal tests: Statistical tests such as Mardia, Henze-Zirkler, and others.
5. **Outlier Identification**: Analysis of outliers using Mahalanobis distances.
6. **Statistical Hypotheses**: Univariate and multivariate tests to verify proposed hypotheses.

## ðŸ›  Tools Used

- **R**: Primary language used for the analysis.
- **Packages**:
  - `tidyverse`: Data manipulation and visualization.
  - `MASS`, `MVN`, `mvShapiroTest`: Packages for multivariate normality tests.
  - `kableExtra`, `knitr`: Formatting and presentation of tables.
  - `ggplot2`, `corrplot`: Data visualization.
